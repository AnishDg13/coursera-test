I would normally be asleep by now but I guess a nice weather and the availability of good music is too tempting to let go. Today Chelse had a match against West Brom.

Thiago Silva failed to stop a Baggies' striker, probably Robinson, and Caballero was obviously not able to stop him. It was not his fault.Maybe it was. Anyway, Chelsea went head down into half-time.<a href="#Back">Back to top</a>
